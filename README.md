## React Fundamental Concepts Used in the Project
- Components: Utilized functional components for creating UI elements like buttons, product cards, and forms.
- JSX: Used JSX for combining HTML and JavaScript to render dynamic content.
- Props and State: Managed data flow using props for passing data and state for internal data management within components.
- Event Handling: Handled user inputs and actions through events like onClick, onChange, etc.
- Conditional Rendering: Displayed content based on conditions (e.g., user authentication status, product availability).
- Hooks: Used React hooks like `useState` for managing state and `useEffect` for performing side-effects like fetching data.
- React Router: Implemented navigation between different pages (Home, Products, Cart, etc.).
- Context API: Used for state management across multiple components without prop drilling.

## Data Management
- Context API: Used to manage global state across components, especially for user authentication and cart data.
- Local Storage: Utilized local storage to persist the cart data across sessions and ensure that users donâ€™t lose their selected items when they refresh the page.
